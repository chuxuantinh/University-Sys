## Project Description

The University system provides online courses for students.

Students can search all courses by name, view course details, enroll in free courses (and cancel existing course enrollments), buy paid courses (and cancel course payments), download course resources for courses they have purchased (or are enrolled in), upload course exams on exam day, receive public certificates for courses they have successfully passed.

Administrators can create, edit and delete courses and curriculums.

Trainers can add and remove course resources, evaluate course exams and create and delete course certificates.

- Landing page (all users):
  The Landing page lists active and upcoming courses provided by the University. Any user can view the list of courses and the course details (incl. trainers, schedule, price and number of students already enrolled). Access to the courses resources and exams is available only to enrolled users after successful login.

- Pagination:
  Courses on the Landing page as well as the Active and Archived courses sections are listed with pagination.

- Searching courses by name on the Landing page, Active / Archived courses sections (all users):
  Users can search courses on the Landing page as well as on the Active and Archived courses sections by course name. The search funtionality is available to all users.

- Viewing courses by trainer & Searching trainer's courses by name (logged in users only):
  The course details page contains a link to the course trainer's other trainings. The funtionality is available to logged in users only. Users can also search courses on the trainer's profile page by name, the funtionality is available only to logged in users only.

- Creating / Editing / Deleting Courses (Administrators only):
  Courses can be created by users in Administrator role only. Administrators can edit course details, delete a course, replace the course's trainer, update the course's start and end dates and pricing. Each course has a name, a description, start and end date, price, a single trainer, and a list of course resources.

- Creating / Editing / Deleting Curriculums & Adding / Removing courses to curriculums (Administrators only):
  Curriculums can be created by users in Administrator role only. Administrators can add and remove courses to multiple curriculums.

- Issuing / Deleting Diplomas for successfully covered Curriculums (Administrators only):
  Administrators can review eligible candidates for a diploma (per curriculum). To be considered as eligible for a diploma students, should successfully pass all courses, included in the respective curriculum (i.e. students should have all required course certificates). Administrators can issue curriculum diplomas, as well as revoke existing diplomas. Should a curriculum change and become more demanding (e.g. include more courses), the previously issued diplomas will remain valid unless an Administrator revokes the diplomas.

- Creating / Deleting Roles & Adding / Removing Users to existing roles (Administrators only):
  Roles can be created by users in Administrator role only. Administrators can add and remove roles, as well as add and remove registered users to existing roles. Pre-defined roles: Administrator, Trainer, Blogger.

- Uploading / Deleting Course Resources (Trainers only):
  Course resources can be uploaded by logged in users in Trainer role only and only for the courses they train. Trainers can delete uploaded resources from their own trainings.

- Viewing / Downloading Course Resources (logged in users enrolled in the respective course and course trainers):
  Course resources can be viewed and downloaded only by logged in users enrolled in the respective course or by the course's trainer.

- Uploading / Viewing / Downloading Course Exams (logged in users enrolled in the respective course):
  Course exams can be uploaded by logged in users, enrolled in the respective course on exam day only. Exams can be viewed and downloaded by their creators but cannot be deleted.

- Downloading the latest student course Exam (Trainers only):
  The latest uploaded course exam for any enrolled student in the training can be downloaded by the course trainer when the course is over.

- Evaluating Course Exams (Trainers only):
  Course exams can be evaluated by the course trainer once the exam is over and not later than 1 month after the exam date. The course grade is on the scale from 2.00 (lowest) to 6.00 (highest) and can be updated at any time by the trainer. The grade can easily be converted to other scales.

- Issuing / Deleting Course Certificates (Trainers only):
  Course exams evaluated above 5.00 (on the scale of 2 to 6) will authomatically receive a course certificate when the course trainer updates the grade to an eligible one. Subsequent higher grades will generate a new certificate, however previous certificates will not be authomatically deleted, as the presumption is that certificates should be publicly accessible even if a better result is achieved on retake exams by the student. A trainer has the option, however, to review all course certificates and remove any invalid ones.

- Viewing / Downloading Course Certificates (all users):
  Course cetrtificates are publically accessible. Any user with a link would be able to view the certificate's contents and download the document as a pdf file.

In addition, enrolling in any course, as well as cancellation of enrollment or payment is possible only before the respective course begins.

- Adding / Removing a Paid Course to the Shopping Cart (all users):
  The user shopping cart is accessible to all users (with or without login). Users can add and remove a course from the cart, update or empty the entire cart. If a course in the shopping cart is no longer available (deleted by an Adminitrator) the course will be removed from the shopping cart authomaticaly. User authentication is required before the user can continue to checkout. Logging in will authomatically remove any course that the logged in user has already purchased or is enrolled in. Logging out will clear the shopping cart.

- Checkout (logged in users only):
  Hitting checkout is available to logged in users only and requires a selection of a payment method. Hitting checkout will create a new payment (order) and enroll the user in all courses in the shopping cart. Upon successful payment and enrollment in all courses, the shopping cart will be cleared.

- Storing Users' Shopping Carts:
  A unique shopping cart key is created for all users and stored in the users' HTTP session. All shopping carts are stored in a concurrent dictionary in the Shopping Cart Manager and identified by the unique shopping cart key from the user session. The Shopping Cart Manager itself is registered as a Singleton service.

- Payments / Orders (logged in users):
  Authenticated users can view a list of their own payments (orders). An authenticated user is allowed to cancel a payment (order) only if all courses included in the respective payment (order) have not started yet.

  Users can register providing name, username, email, birthdate and password. Upon registration users are redirected to Login.
